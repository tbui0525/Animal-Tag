## Animal Tag: Operational Layout and Terrain Regulations

**Preamble**
The primary location for the execution of the game designated as "Animal Tag" shall be the Bui household, subject to the specific definitions outlined herein. Any locations external to this document's scope shall be governed by the provisions detailed in "Misc." 
#### Article I: Regions of Play 
<img width="498" height="353" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8566717-16b8-423e-9ad7-abed2ea68862" /> \
**Section A: Eligible Regions**
The playing area shall encompass the living room, the kitchen, and all pathways directly connecting the aforementioned two spaces. The total area is partitioned into six (6) designated regions, hereinafter referenced by numerical labels for documentation purposes only. Players are not required to memorize or cite these numerical labels during active gameplay.
**Section B: Boundaries and Retrieval** \
Players are expressly prohibited from traversing beyond the established boundaries for the purpose of evading a propelled animal. However, a player may temporarily step out of bounds solely for the purpose of retrieving a propelled animal that has exited the designated regions. 

#### Article II: Terrain Regulations 
\
**Section A: Terrain-1 (Fixed Structures)**
- <span style="color:red">Red Terrain (Overhead Traversal)</span>:This category includes structures upon which players are permitted to traverse, specifically the house couches. While traversal above the couch is permissible, the intentional physical manipulation, including pushing or pulling, of the couches to alter their relative location is strictly forbidden. Any movement of the couches resulting from the incidental transfer of momentum during a player's engagement (e.g., running onto or into the couch) shall be deemed permissible.
- <span style="color:brown">Brown Terrain (Underneath Traversal)</span>: This category includes structures beneath which players are permitted to traverse, specifically tables and the piano. Like Red Terrain, the intentional physical manipulation of Brown Terrain is strictly forbidden. Any movement of Brown Terrain resulting from the incidental transfer of momentum during a player's engagement (e.g., running into or bumping from underneath the structure) shall be deemed permissible.
- Chairs (Movable Assets): Chairs, not explicitly depicted in the referenced graph, may be utilized in gameplay, subject to the following sub-sections:
  - Rolling Chairs: May be employed for rapid transportation via the wheel mechanism, as a defensive wall utilizing the chair back, as a tool for separation by rolling the chair into an opponent to create space, and for similar strategic purposes. Rolling chairs shall NOT be physically lifted from the ground, save for instances where the chair has involuntarily tilted or fallen over. Rolling chairs must be contained within Regions 1 through 3 (the living room).
  - Table Chairs: Located in Region 3, these chairs may be slid in and out of their typical position but must not be removed from Region 3. 

**Section B: Terrain-2 (Smaller Objects)**
- Fair Play Objects: These are objects that are authorized targets for impact by a propelled animal, including but not limited to the TV, fans, beanbags, and shoes. These objects shall NOT be used by players as a mechanism for self-defense (e.g., utilizing a cooking utensil or a pool stick to block or maintain distance). These objects are external to the game's core mechanics but are valid elements for play and rebound.
- No-Go Objects (Prohibited Targets): These are objects that shall under NO circumstances be affected by gameplay, including but not limited to the Bible, wall-mounted pictures, fragile statues, and hanging clocks. Should a propelled animal's trajectory be directed toward a No-Go Object, the nearest player SHALL intercede and block the action. Players designated as "It" are strictly forbidden from intentionally aiming for a No-Go Object with the expectation that another player will take the hit, thereby transferring the "It" designation. Similarly, any player utilizing a "sabotage creature" is prohibited from aiming at No-Go Objects. Violation of this section shall result in a punitive action to be determined by the remaining players external to the interaction.
