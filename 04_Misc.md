## Expansions and Flexibility
#### 04_01 New Locations
Upon entering a new designated area for play, the group is required to immediately scout and establish the following parameters:
- Boundaries, which must possess *clear* and defined terminations (e.g., utilize a natural or man-made transition point, such as the edge between a grass field and a sidewalk, rather than an arbitrary point within an undifferentiated space).
- Terrain, which may incorporate park structures, stairs, natural growths (trees), tables, chairs, or other environmental features. The designated play area must inherently include terrain. Areas characterized solely as a single empty room or a large open field are *NOT* permissible. The inherent complexity of the gameplay necessitates terrain for movement and concealment.
- Fair Play and No-Go objects. These elements should be relatively simple for the group to define. The designation of any item as "Fair Play" necessitates a UNANIMOUS agreement by all participants as to its status. Conversely, the designation of an item as a "No-Go" object, primarily established to maximize safety during gameplay, requires the agreement of only ONE participant. 
\
In newly designated areas, the Fox is omitted, and the explicit demarcation of regions is not mandated. Notwithstanding the lack of necessity, participants retain the option and are encouraged to delineate regions should they elect to engage in discourse regarding the application of terrain during the course of gameplay.
#### 04_02 Mechanics
In the course of contemporary events, if players find imbalance in the mechanics of the gameplay, there may be a group meeting assembled in order to balance the mechanics. This may include altering rules of the terrain, rules against certain strategies, etc. This may NOT alter the overall concept of the game (i.e. no “you cannot throw the animal” rule).
Expansion
#### 04_03 Creatures - 01 Expansion
- **Material Composition and Condition of the Creature**: The material of the proposed creature shall receive unanimous approval from all signatories of this document. Inspection shall encompass not only the creature's material but also its condition and quality (e.g., Snowy’s long blue toy would be excluded, not based on material, but due to its compromised, ripped condition).
- **Ability Proposal and Relevance**: Any proposal for a new creature must include a corresponding, well-defined ability. This ability must bear a reasonable association with the real-life counterpart of the creature, thereby facilitating recall and recognition (e.g., the snow leopard possesses "invisibility" due to its camouflage; penguins possess "freeze" due to their habitation in Antarctica). Furthermore, the proposed ability shall not constitute a repetition of an ability currently in use (e.g., the ability "Freeze" shall not be assigned to a polar bear, as it is already allocated to the penguin).
- **Distinguishability**: The creature *must* be readily and unequivocally distinguishable from all other creatures when viewed from a distance (e.g., should a brown snake and a brown worm of identical size be proposed, one of the two must possess clearly discernible differences in attributes such as size, color, pattern, or other identifying characteristics).
#### 04_03 Creatures-2 Alteration
In the course of contemporary events, if players find imbalance in a creature’s ability, a group meeting may be assembled in order to balance said ability. Small changes should be agreed upon by the majority. Major changes should be unanimous. An alter to ability such as penguin freeze increasing to 7 seconds would be small. A complete overhaul of an ability would result in a totally different ability/sabotage.
The end result is such that no support creature is more powerful than another so no person possessing a specific support creature has a greater advantage than another person, creating a game more based on a balance of mental and physical agility. The same goes with sabotages. The overall goal for the sabotages is such that no sabotage is more powerful than the others, but sabotages (in general) are to be relatively stronger than support creatures, resulting in a genuine disadvantage given to those who have been sabotaged. Likewise, the Multiability Creatures typically have the strongest abilities, but are the most complex to use to balance out the advantages.
