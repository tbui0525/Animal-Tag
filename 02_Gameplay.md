## Stipulations of Gameplay
#### Article I: Setup and Configuration

**Section A: Creature Allocation** 
\
- The commencement of the Game necessitates that each Participant be provisioned with a single Creature. One Participant shall be designated the "It," as represented by the Panda Creature. All Creatures not selected for initial allocation shall be dispersed with approximate uniformity across the designated playing Regions, strictly prohibiting their aggregation within a singular location. The aggregate number of Creatures utilized in the Game shall, at a minimum, be equivalent to the sum of Total Participants plus one (Total Participants + 1). Additional Creatures may be incorporated at the discretion of the Participants. The selection of Creatures shall adhere to the following mandatory composition: one Panda to serve as the "It," a minimum of one Creature designated for Sabotage (e.g., the Dog or Snowman), and a minimum of one Creature designated for Self-Help (e.g., the Snow Leopard or Turtle). Detailed descriptions of each Creature's unique Property are set forth in Section III, "Animal Specifics."
\
**Section B: Terrain and Commencement**
\
- Participants are strictly prohibited from commencing the Game while in direct contact with any specialized Terrain. Furthermore, the physical location of said Terrain shall not be altered immediately prior to the commencement of the Game (e.g., the relocation of a rolling chair from Region 2 to the center of Region 1). The Game shall invariably initiate following a three (3) second audible countdown to ensure all Participants are prepared for the active phase of the Game.

#### Article II: Operational Mechanics

**Section A: Creature Properties and Activation**
\
- Within the active Game, every Creature possesses a unique Property. This Property shall not activate instantaneously upon physical contact, save for specific exceptions, including the Panda's designation as "It" and certain Sabotage effects. To maintain clarity and transparency, a Participant utilizing a Creature's unique Property shall issue a verbal announcement, stating either the specific Ability (e.g., the Penguin's "Freeze") or the Species of the Animal (e.g., "Penguin"). The announcement of the Ability is required to be sufficiently specific to inform other Participants, though strict adherence to the exact terminology is not mandated (e.g., "invisible" may be used in lieu of "invincible," or "frozen" in lieu of "freeze"). Analogous latitude is extended to the Species announcement (e.g., "tiger" in lieu of "snow leopard," or "tortoise" in lieu of "turtle"). This requirement is established to ensure all Participants are cognizant of the activated ability and its possessor at any given moment.
- Should a Creature be physically possessed by a Participant, said Creature is hereby deemed "Taken" and is expressly excluded from any contestation or dispute of possession (i.e., prohibition of "animal tug-of-wars"). A Creature that is "Dormant" shall be considered available for possession, or "Taken." A Participant may hold only one (1) "Self-Help" Creature Ability at any one time. The designated "It" Participant is ineligible to possess a "Self-Help" Creature Ability. A Participant may, however, possess both a "Self-Help" Creature Ability and be subject to a "Sabotage" effect. (Refer to Section III, "Animal Specifics," for further definition of terminology). No Participant shall be subject to two (2) concurrent Sabotage effects. In the event a second Sabotage effect makes contact, the Participant shall be governed solely by the most recent Sabotage effect that established contact.
\
**Section B: Interruption of Play and Termination**
\
- Periods of Interruption, hereinafter referred to as "Breaks," and the conclusion of the Game, hereinafter referred to as "Endings," shall occur exclusively upon the unanimous consent of all Participants. During a Break, Participants shall release any Creature currently in their possession. Upon the conclusion of the Break, Participants shall re-establish possession of the Creature held immediately prior to the Break (i.e., a Participant holding a Penguin pre-Break shall not unilaterally switch to the Turtle post-Break). All activated Abilities, including but not limited to the Turtle's lower half Ability, shall be nullified and deactivated during and subsequent to the Break. Participants are not required to return to the precise physical location occupied pre-Break (i.e., a Participant in Region 5 pre-Break may assume a position in Region 4 post-Break, provided they recommence play with the Creature and/or Sabotage status held pre-Break).
\
**Section C: Physical Interaction** 
\
- Participants are permitted to engage in non-injurious physical contact with one another. However, Participants shall NOT perform any action within the Game deemed "Unnecessary Roughness," which may result in injury or harm to another Participant. Non-prohibited physical contact includes, but is not limited to, slight pushing in a restricted passage or the parrying of another Participant's arm. Prohibited physical contact includes, but is not limited to, aggressively pushing another Participant to the ground or the full grasping and pulling of another Participant's arm. The determination of Unnecessary Roughness shall be made with reasonable facility, and in instances of ambiguity, the determination shall favor the classification of Unnecessary Roughness. Should Unnecessary Roughness occur, the Game shall immediately enter a Break or, if the severity warrants, be terminated entirely. Any resulting sanction or "Punishment" shall be determined by the collective body of Participants and shall be commensurate with the harshness of the Unnecessary Roughness. Said Punishment may range from complete forgiveness to a temporary suspension from participation in the Game. In the event the Unnecessary Roughness is determined to be accidental, the Participants shall extend complete forgiveness.
