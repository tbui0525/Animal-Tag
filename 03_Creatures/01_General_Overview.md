## Creature Specifics
Creatures are classified into three distinct categories. These include: “It,” which is exclusively represented by the Panda; “Support” creatures, whose primary function is to benefit the possessor or any player who is not “It”; and “Sabotage” creatures, which are intended not to assist, but rather to disadvantage or 'nerf' another player.
#### It 
The player who last made contact with the Panda shall be designated as "It." The objective of the player designated as "It" is to transfer said designation by causing the Panda to come into contact with another participant. Notwithstanding the rules governing dodgeball, the Panda may ricochet off the playing surface or slide into contact with another player. The player designated as "It" is explicitly prohibited from holding or possessing any other playing object or creature. Said player may, however, be subject to sabotage by other players.
#### Support
Activation of Support creature abilities necessitates the physical release or 'drop' of said creatures. A player is restricted to the utilization of a single support creature ability concurrently. Should a player currently possessing a support creature be designated as "It," the player is required to immediately relinquish possession of the creature. Furthermore, any ability that was actively engaged shall be immediately terminated upon the player's designation as "It."
#### Sabotage
Sabotage creatures shall inherently affect the last individual to establish physical contact with them, irrespective of the circumstances surrounding said contact. Once introduced into play, a sabotage cannot be permanently removed from the game; its effect may only be transferred to an alternate player. Consequently, upon utilization, a sabotage perpetually imposes a distinct disadvantage upon one player. An individual may only bear one sabotage at a time, and the possession of a "Support" item or an "It" designation does not preclude an individual from simultaneously being sabotaged.
