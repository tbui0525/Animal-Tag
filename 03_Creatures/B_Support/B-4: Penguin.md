The Penguin Ability, "Freeze," temporarily incapacitates the player designated as "it" for a duration of three (3) seconds. To mitigate the possibility of excessive or disruptive use, the activation of this "Freeze" ability is subject to a mandatory cooldown period of one minute (60 seconds). This one-minute cooldown shall be uniformly applied to all participants, preventing any player from initiating a subsequent "Freeze" immediately following the termination of a preceding "Freeze" effect.
