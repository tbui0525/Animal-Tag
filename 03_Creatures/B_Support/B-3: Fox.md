The Fox possesses a regional ability and is exempt from the requirement of verbal announcement. The regional ability of the fox dictates that a player in possession of the fox may not be tagged or subjected to sabotage if the player designated as "It" throws the Panda from the same defined region. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the player possessing the Fox is situated between or in the process of transitioning between regions, the player possessing the fox shall be deemed entirely vulnerable.
