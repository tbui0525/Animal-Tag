The "Wool" ability of the Lamb stipulates that any associated effects or "sabotages" are conditional upon the establishment of direct physical contact with the skin of the other player. Garments, including, but not limited to, shirts and shorts, shall be deemed immune from such effects. Furthermore, the Lamb's "Wool" ability shall be forfeited if another player elects to assume control of and utilize said ability.
