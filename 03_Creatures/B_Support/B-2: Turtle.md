The Turtle Ability confers upon the player immunity from all attacks directed at the area extending from the standing waist level and upward (or the approximate equivalent if the player is not standing), specifically including attacks initiated by the "It" and "Sabotages." Notwithstanding this, an attack that strikes the chest of a prone player shall be considered a valid hit, as the point of contact is below the standing waist level. The effect of the turtle ability may be nullified by the activation of a corresponding ability by another participant.
