The Light Llama's ability, designated "Fuse," permits the simultaneous activation of two support creatures' abilities. This dual activation is contingent upon the absence of any other individual utilizing the Light Llama's ability. As the two support creatures are "fused," their respective abilities must be activated concurrently and cannot be independently initiated. Should the combined effect of the two abilities result in a paradoxical or contradictory action (e.g., simultaneous freezing and execution of a movement action), the two creatures shall be deemed incompatible for fusion. Creatures possessing "Multi Ability" status are ineligible for this fusion process.
