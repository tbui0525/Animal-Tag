The Ultra Ball possesses the ability, designated as "Steal," to appropriate an ability from any individual struck by the Ultra Ball. However, the activation of the Ultra Ball's ability is strictly contingent upon it being thrown. Any alternative means of propulsion, including but not limited to kicking, shall not result in the activation of its ability. Should the Ultra Ball make contact with the ground prior to striking the intended target, the action shall be deemed a "miss," and the ability shall consequently fail. In the event the Ultra Ball ricochets and impacts multiple targets before striking the ground, all affected targets shall forfeit their respective abilities, and only the ability of the initial target shall be transferred to the Ultra Ball thrower. Finally, if the target successfully intercepts and secures the Ultra Ball before it makes contact with the ground, the Ultra Ball's ability shall be considered nullified and negated.  Creatures possessing "Multi Ability" status are ineligible to be stolen.
