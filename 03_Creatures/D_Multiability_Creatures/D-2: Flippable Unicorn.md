D-2: Flippable Unicorn: 
The Flippable Unicorn possesses two distinct abilities. Prior to the activation of any specific ability, a mandatory “No ability” phase must be executed. The state of the Flippable Unicorn determines which ability the player has when in possession of the Flippable Unicorn.
- D2-1. White: The white side of the unicorn is immune to all sabotages.Should the player holding the white unicorn come into contact with a sabotage effect, said sabotage shall not be applied to the current player; instead, the original individual subject to the sabotage shall remain sabotaged.
- D2-2. Dark: The dark side of the unicorn temporarily incapacitates the player designated as "It" for a duration of five (5) seconds. To mitigate the possibility of excessive or disruptive use, the activation of this "Freeze" ability is subject to a mandatory cooldown period of one minute (60 seconds). This one-minute cooldown shall be uniformly applied to all participants, preventing any player from initiating a subsequent "Freeze" immediately following the termination of a preceding "Freeze" effect. In addition, for the ability to incapacitate the player designated as “It,” the player must successfully hit the “It” player with the Dark side of the unicorn, rather than a typical activation.
