The Crewmate has 6 different abilities. Each must go through a “No ability” phase before switching. When the Crewmate has no hat, the player will have no ability. The 6 abilities will fit under B. Support or C. Sabotage 
- D1B-1. Banana Slip: When the Crewmate has a Banana Peel on its head, the Crewmate’s location when thrown will be the viable location of being tagged.
The player will only be “It” if the Panda tags the Crewmate.
- D1B-2. Toilet Paper: When the Crewmate has Toilet Paper on its head, Only the backside of the player in possession may be targeted.
- D1B-3. Leaf: When the Crewmate has a Leaf on its head, the player will be immune to carnivorous sabotages (eg. Dog) and get to double use herbivorous/omnivorous self-helps (eg. Turtle, Lion Unicorn) without needing an intermediary creature possession.
- D1C-1. Scrambled Eggs: When the Crewmate has an Egg on its head, everyone is forced to swap creature possessions. Whoever is closest to “It” becomes “It.”
- D1C-2. All Cap: When the Crewmate has a Blue Cap on its head, the last player who touches it will have their last creature ability (ignoring Panda) be defective. (eg. If I tag someone who is holding a fox with the Crewmate, the fox ability is defective until another creature becomes defective).
- D1C-3. Dump: When the Crewmate has the DUMP sign on its head, the last player who touches it will be contained in that room until “It.” DUMP does not work on “It” for this reason.
