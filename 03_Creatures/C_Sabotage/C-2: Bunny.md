The consequence for the player designated as "the bunny" (the last person to physically contact the bunny) is the mandatory adoption to maintain a continuous hopping movement, including while executing a throw. The player is permitted to execute a dive or duck maneuver; however, upon completion of that maneuver, the player must immediately resume the standing position and continue the hopping movement. A player subject to the "bunny sabotage" is prohibited from utilizing any special terrain features.
