The consequence for the player designated as "the Space Monkey" (the last person to physically contact the bunny) is the mandatory adoption of bad navigation. Movement by the player shall be restricted solely to straight lines, with turns permitted exclusively upon making contact with terrain boundaries or the designated out-of-bounds area. Throws are restricted to a directly forward trajectory and may be arched, but lateral throws are strictly prohibited. Throws that ricochet and subsequently make contact shall be deemed valid. Any throw that violates these limitations shall be nullified and not counted.
