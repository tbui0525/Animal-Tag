The consequence for the player designated as "the Snowman" (the last person to physically contact the snowman) is the loss of use of arms. Upon being struck by the snowman, the player shall immediately release possession of any creature currently held. The player may maintain possession by grasping the creature with their foot; however, their hands are deemed out of play, though free to move. Notwithstanding the prohibition on arm usage, a strike to the arm by "it" or another designated "sabotage" shall nevertheless constitute a valid hit.
