The consequence for the player designated as "Snorlax" (the last person to physically contact Snorlax) is inability to move. The designated individual carrying the Snorlax must remain stationary in a single location and can only be relieved of the consequence through a successful transfer of the Snorlax to another player. Should the player attempt to transfer the Snorlax and fail, thereby losing possession, the player must immediately proceed to the location where the Snorlax was lost and assume a stationary position there instead. If the location is designated out of bounds, the player must move the Snorlax to the closest location within the accepted boundaries. A minimum holding period of three (3) seconds in the same location is required before the player may attempt to transfer the Snorlax, which is intended to prevent continuous movement.
