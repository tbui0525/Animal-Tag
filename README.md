# Animal-Tag v2.0
## Official Animal Tag Rules and Regulations

For those of you unfamiliar with GitHub, you can navigate the branches to for version control and see changes over time. This is a way to audit any changes made to the game and have version control and allow us to play "previous versions" of Animal Tag (Think of it as playing MineCraft version 1.8 vs 1.15+ or whatever) You can also create your own branch and which I highly recommend naming [your-name]-[variant name] in order to distinguish it (Think of it as playing Bed Wars or on a Hypixel server, not officially made by the company, but variants made by the community). You will need to create a Github acct to do so and just message me if you run into any editing issuses. \
